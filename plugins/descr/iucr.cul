# TESTS

# Each plugin MUST provide a set of tests. The motivation behind this is
# that web scraping code is inherently fragile, and is likely to break whenever
# the provider decides to redisign their site. CiteULike will periodically
# run tests to see if anything has broken.

# Please provide as comprehensive a set of tests as possible.
# If you ever fix a bug in the parser, it is highly recommended that
# you add the offending page as a test case.

    abstract {Diffuse neutron scattering data have been recorded for the molecular crystal d-benzil, C14D10O2, using the time-of-flight Laue technique on the SXD and PRISMA instruments at ISIS. Using SXD it was possible to access a large fraction of the total three-dimensional reciprocal space out to a Q value of 15 Ã…-1, using only four individual exposures and by making use of the Laue symmetry of the crystal. By segregating the scattered data according to the incident neutron energy used, patterns were obtained from those neutrons in the range of 20 meV to 150 meV, which showed little sign of inelastic effects and so could be compared with previously analysed X-ray data. For neutron energies of <20 meV, interesting inelastic effects were observed, which have been used to obtain an estimate for the energy of phonons associated with a vibrational mode in which an intramolecular mode couples to a low-energy shearing motion of the hydrogen-bonded network linking neighbouring molecules. The estimated value of 8.95 cm-1 (1.11 meV) for this mode is less than the lowest energy mode reported from spectroscopic measurements for hydrogenous benzil (16 cm-1). A model previously derived from analysis of X-ray data observed over a limited range of Q has been used to calculate neutron patterns over the full Q range. Comparison with the present neutron data has shown that while the model gives a good description of the form of the diffuse patterns, the magnitudes of the atomic displacements are underestimated by a factor of 2.25.}

    abstract {Carbonâ€“carbon bond-length measurements have been made, by the method of X-ray crystal analysis, on pyrene, C16H10, 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, C22H14, coronene, C24H12, and 1:12 benzperylene, C22H12. In all these cases definite evidence has been obtained that the bond lengths vary to a small extent in different parts of the molecules. The variation in many cases is not much greater than the possible experimental error, and so it would not be reasonable at this stage to base any very detailed calculations on these findings. In each case the result of the measurements has been compared with that obtained by taking a linear sum of all the KekulÃ© structures and deriving the bond lengths by means of the empirical Pauling-Brockway curve. It is found that this simple treatment gives a surprisingly good qualitative account of the results, especially for coronene and pyrene. The high symmetry of these molecules may simplify the problem, otherwise it is difficult to understand how a treatment which takes no account of the very numerous first and second excited structures can give even this measure of agreement. The chemical properties of these hydrocarbons are discussed in relation to the bond-length data, but no very precise correlation can be made. Application of the Fries rule, which states that structures with benzenoid rings are more important than structures with quininoid rings, tends to improve the agreements in the case of pyrene.}

Recent advances in the AutoBuild wizard and phenix.refine include automated detection and application of NCS from models as they are built, extensive model-completion algorithms and automated solvent-molecule picking. Model-completion algorithms in the AutoBuild wizard include loop building, crossovers between chains in different models of a structure and side-chain optimization. The AutoBuild wizard has been applied to a set of 48 structures at resolutions ranging from 1.1 to 3.2 Ã…, resulting in a mean R factor of 0.24 and a mean free R factor of 0.29. The R factor of the final model is dependent on the quality of the starting electron density and is relatively independent of resolution.}

At2g17340 is a member of the Pfam01937.11 protein family and its structure provides the first insight into the structural organization of this family. A number of fully and highly conserved residues defined by multiple sequence alignment of members of the Pfam01937.11 family were mapped onto the structure of At2g17340. The fully conserved residues are involved in the coordination of a metal ion and in the stabilization of loops surrounding the metal site. Several additional highly conserved residues also map into the vicinity of the metal-binding site, while others are clearly involved in stabilizing the hydrophobic core of the protein. The structure of At2g17340 represents a new fold in protein conformational space.}

    abstract {The title compound, [CuCl2(C7H9N)4], lies on a site of crystallographic 42 (D4) symmetry in the space group P4/Â­nnc, and is isomorphous with the Ni and Co analogues. The Cu and Cl atoms thus lie on a fourfold axis, and the 3,5-Â­lutidine ligands lie on twofold axes. The Cu-Cl distance is 2.7649 (7) Ã… and the Cu-N distance is 2.0510 (12) Ã…. The space group of the Co analogue is revised from Pnnn to P4/Â­nnc.}

    abstract {The Crystallography Open Database (COD), which is a project that aims to gather all available inorganic, metalâ€“organic and small organic molecule structural data in one database, is described. The database adopts an open-access model. The COD currently contains âˆ¼80â€…000 entries in crystallographic information file format, with nearly full coverage of the International Union of Crystallography publications, and is growing in size and quality.}
